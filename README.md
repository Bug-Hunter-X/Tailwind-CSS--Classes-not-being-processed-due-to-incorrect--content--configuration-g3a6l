# Tailwind CSS Configuration Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error in Tailwind CSS configurations: Incorrectly specifying the `content` option, leading to styles not being applied.

## Problem

When using Tailwind CSS, you need to tell it where to look for your HTML, JavaScript, and other files containing Tailwind directives.  The `content` option in your `tailwind.config.js` is crucial for this.

If the `content` array doesn't include all the necessary files or contains incorrect paths, Tailwind won't process the classes within those files. This results in the classes not being compiled into CSS.

## Solution

Ensure that the `content` array in your `tailwind.config.js` includes all files and directories where you use Tailwind classes. Use globbing patterns to cover various file types efficiently.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Observe the missing styles in the `bug.js` example. Note that the `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the correct configuration.
4. Correct the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` to include `./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}` or similar to match your file structure.
